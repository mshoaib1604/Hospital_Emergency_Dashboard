## KPI Requirements

# Number of Patients:
Measure the total number of patients visiting the ER daily.
Display a daily trend using an area sparkline to understand patterns over time, such as peak days or seasonal trends.

# Average Wait Time:
Calculate the average time patients wait before being attended to by a medical professional.
Use an area sparkline to show daily fluctuations and identify days with higher wait times that may require operational adjustments.

# Patient Satisfaction Score:
Analyze the average satisfaction score of patients on a daily basis to evaluate the quality of service provided.
Present a daily trend using an area sparkline to identify dips in satisfaction and correlate them with operational challenges or peak times.

# Number of Patients Referred:
Count the number of patients referred to specific departments from the ER each day.
Use an area sparkline to track daily trends and identify departments with high referral rates, which may require additional resources.

## **DASHBOARD 1 "MONTHLY VIEW"
Objective: Monitor key metrics and trends on a month-by-month basis to identify patterns and areas for improvement.

## -**Charts to Develop:
* Patient Admission Status: Track admitted vs. non-admitted patients.
* Patient Age Distribution: Group patients by 10-year age intervals.
* Department Referrals: Analyze referral trends across different departments.
* Timeliness: Measure the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.
* Gender Analysis: Visualize patient distribution by gender.
* Racial Demographics: Analyze patient data by race.
* Time Analysis: Assess patient volume by day and hour.


## **DASHBOARD 2 "CONSLIDATED VIEW"
Objective: Provide a holistic summary of hospital performance for a selected date range.

## **Charts to Develop:
* Similar metrics as the Monthly View, but aggregated over a customizable date range for broader insights and trend analysis

## **DASHBOARD 3 "PATIENTS DETAILS"
Objective: Offer granular insights into patient-level data to enable detailed analysis and troubleshooting.

## **Charts to Develop: A grid displaying essential fields:
Patient ID
Patient Full Name
Gender
Age
Admission Date
Patient Race
Wait Time
Department Referral
Admission Status

## **Insight
1 Peak Hours Identified: Patient volume consistently peaked between 6 PM and 10 PM, helping optimize staffing schedules during high-demand hours.

2 Wait Time Bottlenecks: Tuesdays and Fridays showed the highest average wait times, signaling the need for workflow adjustments on specific days.

3 Referral Trends: Cardiology and Orthopedics had the most ER referrals, highlighting departments that may need additional resources or personnel.

4 Age Group Dominance: Patients aged 60â€“70 years represented the largest segment of ER visits, indicating increased elderly care demand.

5 Service Efficiency Gaps: Only 60% of patients were attended within 30 minutes, revealing opportunities to improve triage speed and ER responsiveness.
